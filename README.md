# Insurance-Fraud-Data-Analysis-and-Classification

The repository is organized as follows: the jupyter notebook `insurance_fraud.ipynb` contains all the code for the project. Each section is marked with relevant headers. 
Another notebook in the repository is for a statebins graph in R, it's deceptive that the file ends in `ipynb` when the code only runs in R which can easily be remedied
by making an R based google collab notebook. 

The full write up for the respository is avaliable on my blog, [jabedmiah](https://www.jabedmiah.com/2023/06/01/insurance-fraud-classification.html). 

`Insurance Fraud Data Analysis and Classification.docx` is an old write-up and is saved in this repository for archival purposes.
